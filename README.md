# Dataset
This data comes from the Citi Bike Station system site, found here: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

# Analysis
Please see the Analysis.md file for a detailed analysis of some key findings in this data set and accompanying Tableau visualizations.

# Files Structure
The files are organized as follows: 1) directory: "jupyter_notebooks" contains python code I used to read, organize, and repackage the data sets into new csvs 2) the .gitignore holds these large data sets that I imported and exported and 3) the Analysis.md file contains a summary of some overall findings. Much of the same analysis can be found in the Tableau Viz itself.
